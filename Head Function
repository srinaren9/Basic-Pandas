#Program to demonstrate head functions
import pandas as pd
s=pd.Series(['a','b','c','d','e','f','g','h'])
print("head()")
print(s.head())
print("head(4)")
print(s.head(4))
print("head(-2)")
print(s.head(-2))

#When a number is not speicified it will print the first 5 rows
#Regular integer will print the first few rows for head
#Negative Integer will print eveyrthing but the last few rows by count (i.e -2 will print everything but last 2 rows and 4 will print first 4 rows, meanwhile no numbers means first 5 rows will be printed)
